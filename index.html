                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm currently a Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Austin. I am deeply passionate about 
                        Deep Learning and even more dedicated to advancing the fields of Computer Vision and Trustworthy AI. 
                        I believe that applying these concepts in critical fields like healthcare is one of the most challenging barriers in 
                        the AI world. So, my primary focus of research is algorithmic design and optimization of fine-tuning models.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had a constantly-evolving path through computer science in that I started learning HTML/CSS in 8th grade 
                        and took on an interest in AI and Machine Learning during the summer between my sophomore and junior year of high school. I have a technical 
                        background in web development and AI engineering/research -- largely because I love learning new things about math, statistics, and neural networks!

                                I'm currently an Officer Board Member of Texas Luminescence, an AI engineering organization. Last semester, I
                                was a project team lead, directing 11 members across frontend, backend, and ML engineering subteams to
                                build HealthLens, a Computer Vision + NLP powered app to automate dermatology screening. I'm also a member of the Directed Reading Program (DiRP) and
                                Machine Learning & Data Science Club, and I also play for UT Chess Club's A Team.

                                Oh yeah, I also run a coffee business on West Campus for UT students. I post

                    <p>In my life, I've done a few things of which I'm particularly proud, largely because they required several years of sustained effort:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 2025 (fall), I received a total of $1,500 in research funding from the UT Austin department to support my independent research in LLM interaction</li>
                        <li>In 2025 (summer), I completed the 100,000 steps in 24 hours challenge, hiking 47.42 miles and burning 9080 calories in 23 hours and 54 minutes </li>
                        <li>In 2025 (spring), I was admitted to The University of Texas at Austin's B.S program in computer science and UCLA's B.S. program in computer science</li>
                        <li>In 2024, I finished my second independent AI research project and presented it at the 2024 IEEE MIT URTC in front of other chair/faculty members</li>
                        <li>In 2023, I finished my first independent AI research project and presented it at the 2024 IEEE ISEC at Princeton University in front of other chair/faculty members</li>
                        <li>In 2018, I was represented Texas in the Barber Chess Tournament's Middle School Division (1/50 competitors for each state)</li>
                        <li>From 2015 to 2018, I was State Champion for my grade level in the K-12 Texas State Chess Tournament</li>
                        <li>In 2015, I played for the U.S. Junior National Team in the World Youth Chess Championship in Greece</li>
